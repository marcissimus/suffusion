# Suffusion

The Suffusion Theme for WordPress used to be distributed from the official WordPress site at `https://wordpress.org/themes/suffusion`, however it was pulled from the repository in June 2016. This site is intended to serve as the source for the last working version of the code. Note that the author (@sayontan) no longer maintains or offers support for the theme, and the code has been made available at the behest of its users.

## Installation

To install the theme:

1. Download the latest version from the [`dist`](https://github.com/sayontan/suffusion/tree/master/dist) folder of this repository
2. Unzip the contents to your `wp-content/themes`` folder of your WordPress installation
3. Activate the theme from your WordPress dashboard, under Appearance &rarr; Themes

Note that the last version officially released through WordPress was 4.4.9. The ZIP file corresponding to it has been made available in the `dist` folder. In addition there have been two minor modifications to the code (made available as Version 4.5.0):
 * A correction to the code for Audio Post Formats to prevent a fatal error. Note that the error wouldn't occur if you have the Suffusion Shortcodes plugin
 * A small change to allow jQuery Cycle to be used if [Photonic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/photonic) is active. Photonic switched to using a different slideshow script in its version 1.62

## Support

The author has stopped making modifications to the theme and no longer supports the theme actively, but a few collaborators have continued to keep the theme up to date. The original support forum on `https://aquoid.com/forum` was shut down with effect from February 2019, and support will henceforth be provided via this GitHub repository by other volunteers.
