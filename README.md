# Suffusion

The Suffusion Theme for WordPress used to be distributed from the official WordPress site at `https://wordpress.org/themes/suffusion`. However, it was pulled from the repository in June 2016. This site is intended to serve as the source for the last working version of the code. Note that the author (@sayontan) no longer maintains or offers support for the theme, and the code has been made available at the behest of its users.

## Installation

To install the theme:

1. Download the latest version from the [`dist`](https://github.com/sayontan/suffusion/tree/master/dist) folder of this repository
2. Unzip the contents to your `wp-content/themes` folder of your WordPress installation
3. Activate the theme from your WordPress dashboard, under Appearance &rarr; Themes

## Old Versions

The last version officially released through WordPress was 4.4.9. The ZIP file corresponding to it and other old versions have been made available in the [Suffusion Archive](https://github.com/mbtools/suffusion-archive).

## Warranty

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without any warranty; without even the implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.

## Support

The author has stopped making modifications to the theme and no longer supports the theme actively, but a few collaborators have continued to keep the theme up to date. The original support forum on `https://aquoid.com/forum` was shut down with effect from February 2019, and support will henceforth be provided via this GitHub repository by other volunteers.
